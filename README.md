# JIT-compiler
This is my JIT-compiler for optimize execution of bytecode for my [CPU](https://github.com/Mikipaw/MIPT-1sem/tree/master/MIPT_1sem/CPU-3.0).

The main goal of this program is translate bytecode to x86 machine code to make CPU faster.

As a result, it became faster than my original CPU more than 8 times.
